1. [How Operating Systems Work](https://medium.com/cracking-the-data-science-interview/how-operating-systems-work-10-concepts-you-should-know-as-a-developer-8d63bb38331f#:~:text=How%20Operating%20Systems%20Work:%2010%20Concepts%20you%20Should,Communication.%20...%206%20Input/Output%20Management.%20...%207%20Virtualization)<br>
   Learning and understanding how operating system works is one of the most
   essential things to be a good computer engineer. But sometimes, it takes pretty
   much time to get the summary of all of it. James Le had summarize the work flow of
   operating system with ten concepts we have to know as a developer as addition. He might missed some details, yet it was enough to cover the main flow.

2. [A Beginners Guide to Linux](https://www.lifewire.com/beginners-guide-to-linux-4090233)<br>
   As computer engineers, we might be familiar with the word 'Linux'. But
   some of us might haven't tried it yet. In this page, Gary Newell explains about
   some fundamental things that we should know when we are going to switch to Linux as
   our operating system; starts from explaining what is Linux, how to install it, and
   of course some of its utilities.

3. [Game Console Operating Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTVyx4AO18U)<br>
   Knowing that a computer is run by an operating system is a common thing for us to hear. But what about gaming consoles? Lots of us consider that gaming consoles are just mere hardwares. Hence, we sometimes do forget about their operating system. How does an operating system work in a gaming console? Well, for XBox, it probably uses Windows, as we know Windows is developed by Microsoft. But what about the other?

4. [Can your computer run without an operating system?](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/computer-run-without-operating-system.htm)<br>
   Operating system is an essential thing for a computer. But do you know that a computer could run without an operating system? Early computers don't actually have operating system. They were controlled by humans manually. So, what if we don't have any operating system in our devices?

5. [GitLab vs GitHub: Key differences & similarities](https://usersnap.com/blog/gitlab-github/)<br>
   Some developers prefer Github, yet some prefer Gitlab. But what are the pros and cons between both of them? They might look similar but one have the advantages of another and vice versa. Through this link, I learned which Git platform should I use for certain projects.
