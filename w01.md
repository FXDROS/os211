# Top 10 List of Week 01

1. [How Operating Systems Work](https://medium.com/cracking-the-data-science-interview/how-operating-systems-work-10-concepts-you-should-know-as-a-developer-8d63bb38331f#:~:text=How%20Operating%20Systems%20Work:%2010%20Concepts%20you%20Should,Communication.%20...%206%20Input/Output%20Management.%20...%207%20Virtualization)<br>
   Learning and understanding how operating system works is one of the most
   essential things to be a good computer engineer. But sometimes, it takes pretty
   much time to get the summary of all of it. James Le had summarize the work flow of
   operating system with ten concepts we have to know as a developer as addition. He might missed some details, yet it was enough to cover the main flow.

2. [A Beginners Guide to Linux](https://www.lifewire.com/beginners-guide-to-linux-4090233)<br>
   As computer engineers, we might be familiar with the word 'Linux'. But
   some of us might haven't tried it yet. In this page, Gary Newell explains about
   some fundamental things that we should know when we are going to switch to Linux as
   our operating system; starts from explaining what is Linux, how to install it, and
   of course some of its utilities.

3. [Game Console Operating Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTVyx4AO18U)<br>
   Knowing that a computer is run by an operating system is a common thing for us to hear. But what about gaming consoles? Lots of us consider that gaming consoles are just mere hardwares. Hence, we sometimes do forget about their operating system. How does an operating system work in a gaming console? Well, for XBox, it probably uses Windows, as we know Windows is developed by Microsoft. But what about the other?

4. [Can your computer run without an operating system?](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/computer-run-without-operating-system.htm)<br>
   Operating system is an essential thing for a computer. But do you know that a computer could run without an operating system? Early computers don't actually have operating system. They were controlled by humans manually. So, what if we don't have any operating system in our devices?

5. [GitLab vs GitHub: Key differences & similarities](https://usersnap.com/blog/gitlab-github/)<br>
   Some developers prefer Github, yet some prefer Gitlab. But what are the pros and cons between both of them? They might look similar but one have the advantages of another and vice versa. Through this link, I learned which Git platform should I use for certain projects.

6. [How You Can Have Multiple Operating Systems on Your Computer](https://www.howtogeek.com/187789/dual-booting-explained-how-you-can-have-multiple-operating-systems-on-your-computer/#:~:text=Most%20computers%20ship%20with%20a%20single%20operating%20system,,at%20boot%20time%20%E2%80%94%20is%20known%20as%20%E2%80%9Cdual-booting.%E2%80%9D)<br>
   Instead of using a virtual machine, we can actully do something called as dual booting to get full experience of multiple operating systems in our device. Yet, there might be some drawbacks rather than using a virtual machine. Here, I learned about how to dual booting in my computer and how to switch between those operating systems.

7. [Learn Regular Expressions In 20 Minutes](https://youtu.be/rhzKDrUiJVk)<br>
   For a novice person like me, sometimes it is hard just to read all the documentations and try it by myself without any "teacher". Through this video, Web Dev Simplified will help us to know some basics about regular expressions by hands on practice and a basic example that's pretty covered up the whole video.

8. [Vim in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-txKSRn0qeA)<br>
   Vim is an amazing text editor since it helps us reduce redundancy of touching back our mouse or trackpad while coding. Yet, it can be troublesome for us when we are haven't familiar with its command. Here, Joe Previte introduce Vim on Visual Studio Code; so we can use both of Vim and VSCode advantages.

9. [How To Make An Operating System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJUGVFAXKg)<br>
   Reading the introduction of operating system in a reference reminds of Introduction of Computer Organization. We learned about assembly language and even implemented it. But what it could actually do is far beyond a simple program. It actually one of many computer languages that we can use to make an operating system.

10. [Ten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10)<br>
    Nunc imperdiet gravida lorem vitae tincidunt.
    Phasellus tristique nulla at justo finibus pulvinar.
    Phasellus in leo vitae sem congue sollicitudin eu sed risus.
    Aliquam erat volutpat.
    Proin in erat fringilla, pulvinar nisl quis, vulputate purus.
