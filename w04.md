# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [Examples of Makefile in C and Java](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~newhall/unixhelp/howto_makefiles.html)<br>
    Ever feeling tired because of the inefficiency of compiling a .c file at a time? Well, this site will guide you how to run or compiling multiple C files at once together with some examples and usecase.

2. [Contiguous Memory Allocation Explained](https://binaryterms.com/contiguous-memory-allocation-in-operating-system.html)<br>
   Quoting from the content "Contiguous memory allocation is a memory allocation method that allocates a single contiguous section of memory to a process or a file." But how to process those files exactly? How an operating system manage the fragmantations?

3. [C Pointers](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_pointer_to_pointer.htm)<br>
We often heard the word "pointers" especially when we are using stack data type. But what are those pointers actually do? How a pointer point to an address of a component?

4. [Why choose Makefile over bash script](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22578909/what-is-the-difference-between-makefile-and-sh-file)<br>
   Both of them probably similar. But why do someone choose or even reccomend us to use Makefile? Some said that it is more efficient to use Makefile. Well, what does make it more efficient than sh file?

5. [What does .c and .h file extension do in C](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1695224/what-do-c-and-h-file-extensions-mean-to-c)<br>
   Programmers are familiar with file extension such as .java for java programs/files, .py for python, as well as .c and .h for C programs. But what does it actually do? Why we need those extensions especially in C?

6. [What is Makefile and how does it work](https://opensource.com/article/18/8/what-how-makefile)<br>
 Okay okay I get it. I recently mentioned about Makefile, yet I haven't explained what is Makefile. We can simply say that Makefile is a tool (in my opinion pretty similar wiht bash script) that helps you by reducing repetitive workflow. Isn't it amazing?!

7. [What is a Memory Management Unit (MMU)](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/memory-management-unit-MMU)<br>
   Based on the title: Memory Management Unit; means a hardware component that manages all operations relating to memory that associated with the processor. Well, what do you expect?

8. [Memory Management in OS](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_memory_management.htm)<br>
   We know that our computers need memory and sometimes we even complain if we don't have enough memory. But do we actually know how our operating system manages those memory of our devices? You can check it through this site and you will get visualisation bonus as well ;D

9. [Byte vs Word Addressable Memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-byte-addressable-memory-and-word-addressable-memory/?ref=rp)<br>
   Alright, I do remember now. My lecturer ever taught me about byte and word addressing. But seemslike I can't recall some of the details. Hey, this site looks pretty good handling my problems! Why don't you go and check it as well if you want to understand more about word and byte addressing? 

10. [How to see/check memory usage on Linux](https://www.binarytides.com/linux-command-check-memory-usage/)<br>
    So here's the thing. My friend PC was freezed and both of us taught that it was because of massive memory usage that almost reach it's capacity. Well, I helped him by Googling and do the GSGS spell. Look what I found! A site that might help you guys as well if you have the same problem as him :D
