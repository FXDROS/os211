# Top 10 List of Week 03

1. [Virtual filesystems in Linux: Why we need them and how they work](https://opensource.com/article/19/3/virtual-filesystems-linux)<br>
    Each devices have their own file system; probably same as others but might be not. For example, Windows operating system use NTFS for its file system and MacOS use Journaled. But they can use the same file system as well such as FAT. The thing is, do we need lots of specification for our application to access different file systems? Well, we can use what we called as Virtual File System as an abstraction layer.

2. [File Allocation Methods-Linked Allocation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI3MACfFfFc)<br>
   In Data Structure course we learnt about linked-list; which every element of the list is placed scatteredly in the memory. Well, we can use such method as well to allocate our files. Here is a visualization of how files are kept using Linked Allocation.

3. [Beginner Geek: Hard Disk Partitions Explained](https://www.howtogeek.com/184659/beginner-geek-hard-disk-partitions-explained/)<br>
Sometimes we want to have multiple storage system, yet we don't want to spend too much room for disk.Actually, we can do partitioning; to isolate a part and another of our disk drive(s). How to partitioning, when to do it, and what are the things that we have to concern about?

4. [Operating Systems: Crash Course Computer Science](https://youtu.be/26QPDBe-NB8)<br>
   Have you ever wondered how nowadays devices could run multiple applications or programs all at once? How exactly do they manage their storage, their memmory, accessing them, and others? Well in this video, we could get some abstractions about how it works. 

5. [How Data Recovery Works](https://youtu.be/PWuWOSOCGxE)<br>
   Data lost could happens anytime and it is a common thing. Some of us might known already about data recovery software. But do we know how does it really work? How the algorithm detects the lose data? Let's check it out in this video!

6. [Building a Fuse File System](https://medium.com/@cris178/building-a-fuse-file-system-ee8f90fd0a2f)<br>
 We probably know that FUSE is a userspace filesystem framework that consist of a kernel module, userspace library, and mount utility. Now, what if we make our own Fuse File System? Through this article we will get the basic idea of building our own fuse system.  

7. [What Is a File System, and Why Are There So Many of Them?](https://www.howtogeek.com/196051/htg-explains-what-is-a-file-system-and-why-are-there-so-many-of-them/)<br>
   Now, we have heard several times before about file systems. But what are file systems actually? There are some types of file systems, each of them was made considering its ussage and compability; for instance NTFS for Windows.

8. [File Allocation Methods](https://www.tutorialandexample.com/file-allocation-methods/#:~:text=Contiguous%20Allocation:%20%E2%80%93%20Contiguous%20allocation%20is%20one%20of,that%20in%20the%20directory,%20we%20have%20three%20files.)<br>
   Previously we have discussed about Linked Allocation method. But there are some more, such as contiguous allocation; which data blocks are allocated adjacently in order to gives an excellent read performance. Another method is Indexed Allocation Method. How does it work? Let's find out thorugh this article.

9. [User Accounts, Groups, Permissions & Their Role in Sharing](https://www.howtogeek.com/school/windows-network-sharing/lesson1/)<br>
   An operating system manage file systems and its sharing network. For example, an administration account could access every data in every user, and every user shares and gives access and informations to the administration account. Here is an example of how file sharing systems work in Windows Operating System.

10. [Clustered File System](https://www.weka.io/learn/clustered-file-system/)<br>
    Clustered file system allows us to organise data access accross clusters of data, so that user could access the same data continuously. It comes handy when we have to bundle our servers into a single cluster, since direct storage management between an operating system and a storage server could be complicated.
