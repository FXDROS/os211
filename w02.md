# Top 10 List of Week 02

1. [Live Cyber Threat Map](https://threatmap.checkpoint.com/)<br>
   There's actually not much we can learn from this link actually. But this website give us a simple yet enough to cover visualisation of cyber attacks and threats in a current time. There are three types of cyber attacks displayed; first malware attack, seccond is pishing and last is exploitation. This site also shows us top targetes lists and Indonesia is unfortunately on of them.

2. [8 Most Common Cybersecurity Threats](https://youtu.be/Dk-ZqQ-bfy4)<br>
   Not only software engineers but lots of people use electric devices. We probably protect and secure them from physical attacks such as robbery. Yet, we probably unaware of cyber attacks that might damage our devices internally and steal some of our personal data and information. What are those threats? Let's find out in this video.

3. [All About Malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware/#what-is-the-history-of-malware)<br>
   There are probability that our devices contain malware. But, there is also a huge probability that we don't realise it. Malware could be detected by looking at some symptoms at our devices. What are those and how to remove them? We can learn all of those things by looking at this site. This site not only tells us about malware on computer OS, yet it also tells us about some tips on handling malware on our smartphones.

4. [What Is AES Encryption and How Does It Work?](https://cybernews.com/resources/what-is-aes-encryption/#:~:text=How%20does%20AES%20encryption%20work?%201%20Dividing%20data,round%20key.%20...%208%20Rinse%20and%20repeat.)<br>
   There are lots of threats towards our devices, especially our operating system. But do we really know what kind of protection that we can do to prevent those attacks? As software engineers, knowing about cryptography is one of the most important thing. One of its form is AES Encryption. It works by dividing, subtituting, shifting, and other data manipulations in order to protect the data. Let's know more about it!

5. [Trojan Horse (Computing)](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/Trojan-horse)<br>
   Some of us probably know that Trojan Horse is one of the most common malware in the computer world. There are some ways that attackers could put trojan horse; it could be by email, downloaded files, and many other ways just like any other malwares. Trojan horse might be look harmless in a glympse, yet it could be a nuisance. A trojan horse program could do several things in your devices such as changing the screen resolution, adding latency towards responses of your external devices such as mouse and keyboards, and many more. So, how do we remove it?

6. [Making Virus In Python](https://youtu.be/M538iAJB_2c)<br>
   Than just learning from how to prevent malware or virus, why don't we learn from the difference perspective instead? In this video, we can learn about how a virus program works byw the demonstration shown. It is a simple program, yet could give us a clear view about how a virus actually harm our files.

7. [Asymmetric Encryption?](https://www.educba.com/asymmetric-encryption/)<br>
   Before we have read some about AES Encryption and we know that it is one of the most popular symmetric encryption. Even though it is one of security algorithm, still it has some drawbacks such as risk while exchanging the key in network, since symmetric encryption only use a key that used for encryption and decryption. To handle such case, there is something called as asymmetric encryption that use a pair of key (private: for encryption and public: for decryption) 

8. [Test Your AntiVirus Program](https://www.malwarefox.com/test-antivirus/)<br>
   There are lots of antivirus programs in the internet and sold online. We choose one of them, purchase and installed it, and we hope our computer/device is protected. Hey, I won't be so sure if I were you. There's nothing wrong in trusting the antivirus that you subscribed, but it will be better if you test it first by some programs in order to check its reliability.

9. [SSH Tunnel](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/tunneling/)<br>
   There are some ways to connect to a server through SSH, one of them is through a SSH tunnel. It is one of the most practical way to transfer data from a server to another by SSH. Well as we know, as long as we connect to a public server, there are possibilities for us to be exploited towards malware or even pishing. How does actually hacker or cracker steal our data through a tunnel?

10. [Why Cheksum?](https://www.howtogeek.com/363735/what-is-a-checksum-and-why-should-you-care/)<br>
    In this operating system course, we learn about SHA-256. But what it is actually? SHA-256 is a kind of checksum. A checksum file is a file that we use to validate to whom the file belogns to. We should concern about it to prevent files modification by strangers or people that actually don't have any permission.
