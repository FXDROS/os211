# Top 10 List of Week 02

1. [Live Cyber Threat Map](https://threatmap.checkpoint.com/)<br>
   There's actually not much we can learn from this link actually. But this website give us a simple yet enough to cover visualisation of cyber attacks and threats in a current time. There are three types of cyber attacks displayed; first malware attack, seccond is pishing and last is exploitation. This site also shows us top targetes lists and Indonesia is unfortunately on of them.

2. [8 Most Common Cybersecurity Threats](https://youtu.be/Dk-ZqQ-bfy4)<br>
   Not only software engineers but lots of people use electric devices. We probably protect and secure them from physical attacks such as robbery. Yet, we probably unaware of cyber attacks that might damage our devices internally and steal some of our personal data and information. What are those threats? Let's find out in this video.

3. [All About Malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware/#what-is-the-history-of-malware)<br>
   There are probability that our devices contain malware. But, there is also a huge probability that we don't realise it. Malware could be detected by looking at some symptoms at our devices. What are those and how to remove them? We can learn all of those things by looking at this site. This site not only tells us about malware on computer OS, yet it also tells us about some tips on handling malware on our smartphones.

4. [What Is AES Encryption and How Does It Work?](https://cybernews.com/resources/what-is-aes-encryption/#:~:text=How%20does%20AES%20encryption%20work?%201%20Dividing%20data,round%20key.%20...%208%20Rinse%20and%20repeat.)<br>
   There are lots of threats towards our devices, especially our operating system. But do we really know what kind of protection that we can do to prevent those attacks? As software engineers, knowing about cryptography is one of the most important thing. One of its form is AES Encryption. It works by dividing, subtituting, shifting, and other data manipulations in order to protect the data. Let's know more about it!

5. [Trojan Horse (Computing)](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/Trojan-horse)<br>
   Some of us probably know that Trojan Horse is one of the most common malware in the computer world. There are some ways that attackers could put trojan horse; it could be by email, downloaded files, and many other ways just like any other malwares. Trojan horse might be look harmless in a glympse, yet it could be a nuisance. A trojan horse program could do several things in your devices such as changing the screen resolution, adding latency towards responses of your external devices such as mouse and keyboards, and many more. So, how do we remove it?

6. [Making Virus In Python](https://youtu.be/M538iAJB_2c)<br>
   Than just learning from how to prevent malware or virus, why don't we learn from the difference perspective instead? In this video, we can learn about how a virus program works byw the demonstration shown. It is a simple program, yet could give us a clear view about how a virus actually harm our files.

7. [Learn Regular Expressions In 20 Minutes](https://youtu.be/rhzKDrUiJVk)<br>
   For a novice person like me, sometimes it is hard just to read all the documentations and try it by myself without any "teacher". Through this video, Web Dev Simplified will help us to know some basics about regular expressions by hands on practice and a basic example that's pretty covered up the whole video.

8. [Vim in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-txKSRn0qeA)<br>
   Vim is an amazing text editor since it helps us reduce redundancy of touching back our mouse or trackpad while coding. Yet, it can be troublesome for us when we are haven't familiar with its command. Here, Joe Previte introduce Vim on Visual Studio Code; so we can use both of Vim and VSCode advantages.

9. [How To Make An Operating System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJUGVFAXKg)<br>
   Reading the introduction of operating system in a reference reminds of Introduction of Computer Organization. We learned about assembly language and even implemented it. But what it could actually do is far beyond a simple program. It actually one of many computer languages that we can use to make an operating system.

10. [What is Linux and Why There are 100â€™s of Linux Distributions?](https://itsfoss.com/what-is-linux/)<br>
    I didn't know that Linux is just a kernel until just now. Abhishek Prakash explained how what is Linux, how does it work, and why there are lots of Linux based operating systems with a nice analogy and pretty much understandable for beginners.
