# Top 10 List of Week 07

1. [It Is Not A Flag!](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/semaphores-in-operating-system)<br>
    We probably often heard about sempahore flags which used for giving signs at navy or scouts activity. But, in operating system, semaphores stands for a different meaning. We can say that it is one of many solutions to solve critical problem. This article discusses about simaphores' signals, their benefits and drawbacks.

2. [Deadlock? Let's Solve It!](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deadlock-prevention/)<br>
   We know that deadlock is something we avoid the most. But sometimes we don't know what to do and how to avoid such thing. Let's check this article to solve your 'deadly' problem.

3. [Who Will Win?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aF0q7NfwfA)<br>
 Previous week we have discussed a little bit about process synchronization. Well, while synchronizing, there are possibilities that two or more code access and process the same data. And what about the outcome? It all depends on who have the earlier order.

4. [Mutex? What is It?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvF3AsTglUU)<br>
   In synchronization, there is a locking mechanism called as mutex. Well, in mutex, there is somekind of ownership, that allows the owner (thread or process) to release the lock/mutex. For further understanding, check out this video!

5. [How to use POSIX semaphores in C language](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/use-posix-semaphores-c/)<br>
    You probably often heard about library of a programming language. In this case, there is POSIX for C programming language. POSIX is Portable Operating System Interface, which means we can utilize for maintaining compability between OS. But how exactly we take advantage of POSIX for semaphores?

6. [Resource Starvation?](://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01DiVzZbRjY)<br>
  Okay so we knwo that if your greedy sibling eats all of your food at home, you'll end up starving. That is exactly what happened when greedy treads make shared resources unavailable for a long periods, causing or caused by deadlock adn livelock.

7. [What is Lifelock?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_1unN40Os0)<br>
   Okay so we know about deadlock, so...what about livelock? It's pretty the opposite. If deadlock is caused by "queuing", livelock is caused by processes that meaninglessly, continually, repeating the same interaction.

8. [Chemisrty Atom?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn1GEmBsPmQ)<br>
   Hey, this is an operating system course, so we don't discuss chemistry here lol. But there are actually these things that we called as atomic operations, such as wait() and slee() that we've learned in the previous week. As its name, an atomic operation runs completely independent; is not affected by other programs.

9. [Dump Dump Hexdump](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hexdump-command-in-linux-with-examples/)<br>
    So, while doing week 7 assignments, I found something interesting and as the title said, it was Hexdump. Quoting from the article : *The hd or hexdump command in Linux is used to filter and display the specified files, or standard input in a human readable specified format."*

10. [Difference between wait() and sleep()](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1036754/difference-between-wait-and-sleep)<br>
    So, last week we have learned about wait() and sleep(), but what are the differences between both of them actually, since for a glimpse, bot of them seems the same things. So, after reading the forum, I suppose the difference is that wait() can be "woken up" yet sleep can't.
